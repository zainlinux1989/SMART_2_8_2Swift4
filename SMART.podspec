                   Swift SMART on FHIR framework for iOS and OS X.
                   
                   Swift-SMART is a full client implementation of the ðŸ”¥FHIR specification for building apps that
                   interact with healthcare data through [**SMART on FHIR**](http://docs.smarthealthit.org).
                   
                   Start with `import SMART` in your source files. Code documentation is available from within
                   Xcode (ALT + click on symbols) and on [smart-on-fhir.github.io/Swift-SMART/](http://smart-on-fhir.github.io/Swift-SMART/).
